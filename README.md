* Usage: 
```
	python  l33t_cutWords_tool.py  [inputfile(.l33t)]  [outputfile(.txt)]
```

* Example:
## There is a l33t file "helloworld.l33t", and I used this tool to translate it:

```
	python l33t_cutWords_tool.py helloworld.l33t out.txt
```

## and I pressed Enter key,
```
	Translated to real code is successful! 
	out.txt created.
```

## The outputfile "out.txt" is created now, and let's open it.
```
	inc 10
	if
		nop
		fwd 1
		inc 7
		bak 1
		dec 1
		eif
	fwd 1
	nop


	... etc
```
## The l33t code is now translated to a easy-to-see pattern.
